# Exercise: Device Query

In this exercise, we will test a simple CUDA program that queries the attached CUDA devices and gathers information about them using the CUDA Runtime API. No CUDA programming is involved; rather, the goals of this exercise are simply to demonstrate how to prepare and submit a GPU job, and to see how the Runtime API can be used to discover hardware properties.
